            Students must pay their monthly fees on or before the due date to maintain uninterrupted access to all resources, services, and facilities. Timely payments help ALO continue providing high-quality education and support. If you face unexpected financial challenges, we encourage you to contact the finance department. We work collaboratively to find solutions while maintaining confidentiality. Late payments may result in restricted access until fees are cleared.

            Consistent attendance is key to academic success and professional development. Regular class participation helps students better understand course material and develop a strong work ethic. To qualify for placement assistance, students must maintain a minimum attendance of 90%. Prioritizing classes ensures that students are fully prepared for their future careers.

            Placement opportunities at ALO Educational Hub are available to students who demonstrate excellence in both attendance and academic performance. Students must maintain an A-grade (within the Aâ€“C range) to be considered for placements. Weekly assessments, active participation, and consistent effort are crucial for achieving this standard. Our faculty and staff provide guidance and support to help students meet these requirements and maximize career opportunities.
